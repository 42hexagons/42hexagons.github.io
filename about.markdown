<h4 class="display-4 text-center mb-5">A few words about us</h4>

42Hexagons is the name of a software editor company. The name has been chosen because of 42
(which is the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything) and Hexagons
because, well, we needed to put a little bit of French reference into its name (The France looks
like an hexagon if you didn't get the picture).

Our adventure started back in 2019 when two crazy software engineer developed their first product
for gig workers: the well known [Flexomatic app](https://www.flexomatic.app) which is now being
used by over 5,000 customers worldwide.

We have ambitious goals, eager to solve real world problems and we do love our work! If you are
comfortable with full telecommuting work and a multicultural environment, you may want to take a
