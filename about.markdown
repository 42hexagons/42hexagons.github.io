<h4 class="display-4 text-center mb-5">A few words about us</h4>

42Hexagons is the name of a software editor company. The name has been chosen because of 42
(which is the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything) and Hexagons
since, well, we needed to put a little bit of French reference into its name (The France looks
like an hexagon, and is often referred to as “L’Hexagone” in our mother tongue).

Our adventure started back in mid-2019 when two crazy software engineers developed their first product
for gig workers: the well known [Flexomatic app](https://www.flexomatic.app) which is now being
used by over 6,000 customers worldwide.

We have ambitious goals, eager to solve real world problems and we do love our work. We are also
constantly looking for talented people who love what they do in their everyday life and willing
to impact on the world.

If you are comfortable with full telecommuting work into a multicultural environment,
you may want to take a look at our job offers.
