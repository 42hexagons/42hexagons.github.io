# (Intern) Fullstack Software Developer

42Hexagons is looking for a Software Developer intern to complete its software
team on Flexomatic.

## The context

Our product is a niche Android app deployed on thousand of devices which helps
independent delivery workers grab pieces of work called "Blocks" on Amazon
Flex. Each day, our app grabs more than 300 blocks for our customers as we
have to provide them with constant reliability so they don't have to manually
search work; instead, they only focus on delivery and nothing else.

## Job content

Being part of the software team, you will refer to our CTO and take part to
our whole stack by:

- adding new features on our server which communicate with our mobile app;
- adding new features on our mobile app;
- develop third-party productivity tools to help us in our daily work.

## Required skills

- **You are a good problem solver**. As you are currently studying, we won't
ask you for “years of experience”. We expect you to be able to solve basic
algorithm problems. A fairly amount of autonomy is required as well, as you
will likely be in an environment where you just discover new tools and
technologies you might have not seen before.
- **Knowledge of at least one imperative language**. We are using Kotlin for
our mobile app and Python (especially the Flask microframework) for the server
part. We don't expect you to know these languages, we just want you to show us
that you know one language right and that you can sort things out with it.
- **English proficiency**. The team is majoritarily made of French speakers, so
whether you come from an English spoken country or elsewhere, we will have to
communicate in proper English.
- German or Spanish proficiency is a plus.

## Location

Full-remote. We are all based in France so if you are close to UTC+1, that
would be great but that should not stop you to apply.

## Apply

Shoot us a resume at hello@42hexagons.org.
