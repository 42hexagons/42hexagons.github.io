# (Contractor) Android developer

42Hexagons is looking for an Android Developer to complete is software team on
Flexomatic.

## The context

Our product is a niche Android app deployed on thousand of devices which helps
independent delivery workers grab pieces of work called "Blocks" on Amazon
Flex. Each day, our app grabs more than 300 blocks for our customers as we
have to provide them with constant reliability so they don't have to manually
search work; instead, they only focus on delivery and nothing else.

## Job content

Being part of the software team, you will refer to our CTO and develop our
mobile app by:

- bringing brand new features to life;
- enhance the codebase and constantly ensuring it preserves a maintanable state;
- adding tests and enforcing them so there will be no regression on the app.


## Required skills

- **Significant experience on the Android environment**. We are not asking for
“years of experience”; if you have a few apps to show us, that would be great.
- **Knowledge of Java or Kotlin**. We are using the latter to work and we don't
intend to use Java; it's just that it is fine if you haven't written any single
line of code of Kotlin before, as long as you are willing to learn and knows
how Oriented Object Programming works.
- **English proficiency**. The team is majoritarily made of French speakers, so
whether you come from an English spoken country or elsewhere, we will have to
communicate in proper English.
- **You know how to use a Version Control System (VCS)**. We work with github
on a daily basis, so we expect you to be able to handle git if you don't already
know it.
- German or Spanish proficiency is a plus.

## Location

Full-remote. We are all based in France so if you are close to UTC+1, that
would be great but that should not stop you to apply.
