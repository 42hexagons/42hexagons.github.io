# Android Software Engineer

42Hexagons is looking for an Android Software Engineer to complete its software development team for its flagship product: Flexomatic.

## The context

Our product is a niche Android app deployed on thousands of devices which helps independent delivery workers grab pieces of work called “Blocks” on Amazon Flex. Every single day day, our app grabs around 1000 blocks for our customers on their behalf, sparing time and money for them.

## Job content

Being part of the software development team, you will refer to our CTO and take part in the Android app development. Here are the key points of your role:

- bringing brand new features to life;
- enhance the codebase and constantly ensuring it preserves a maintainable state;
- adding tests and enforcing them so there will be no regression on the app;
- enforcing technical watch to update and improve our tools.


Examples of major features we would like to implement:

- Advanced filters to let our most advanced users take some real advantages of our product for their schedule.
- improved UI/UX to help the users find their way around the app.
- Duplication of Flexomatic on the other actors of the Gig Economy (Deliveroo, Instacart, Glovo, Spark Driver etc.), with total freedom to reinvent the stack.


## Required skills

- Significant experience on Android Development. We are not asking for “years of experience”; if you have a few websites/apps to show us and tell us how your work fit into it, that would be great.
- Knowledge of the Android ecosystem regardless of the language being used. We are using Kotlin, but as a software engineer, you should be able to tackle issues by yourself.
- English proficiency. The team is majoritarily made of French speakers, so whether you come from an English spoken country or elsewhere, we will have to communicate in proper English. French is a plus for sure. :)
- You know how to use a Version Control System (VCS). We work with github on a daily basis, so we expect you to be able to handle git if you don’t already know it.
- Knowledge of how RESTful APIs work and how to reverse engineer an Android app is a great plus!

## Technical environment
Frontend : HTML/Bootstrap (for the landing page) – Android/Kotlin for our app.
Backend : Python 3.8/Flask.
Database: PostgreSQL.
Infrastructure: Heroku.
Other: Git, ClickUp, Slack.

## Location

Full-remote allowed. Most of the team is based in Lyon, France. If you are close to UTC+2, that would be great but that should not help you from applying to this position.

## Additional information

The expected workload is of 40 hr/week maximum with a negotiable hourly rate. We are looking for a mid-term collaboration starting ASAP.

## Apply

Shoot us a resume at hello@42hexagons.org.
