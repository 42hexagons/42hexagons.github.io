# Senior backend software engineer

42Hexagons is looking for a Senior Backend Software Engineer to complete its
software developement team on its phare product: [Flexomatic](https://www.flexomatic.app/).

## The context

Our product is a niche Android app deployed on thousands of devices which helps
independent delivery workers grab pieces of work called "Blocks" on Amazon
Flex. Every single day day, our app grabs around 200 blocks for our customers
on their behalf, sparing time and money for them.

## Job content

Being part of the software development team, you will refer to our
CTO and take part in the backend development. Here are the key points of your
role:

- bringing brand new features to life;
- enhance the codebase and constantly ensuring it preserves a maintanable state;
- adding tests and enforcing them so there will be no regression on the app;
- enforcing technical watch to update and improve our tools.


## Required skills

- **Significant experience on Web development**. We are not asking for
“years of experience”; if you have a few websites to show us and tell us how
your work fit into it, that would be great.
- **Knowledge of an imperative programming language**. We are using **Python**
and **Flask**, but you are not required to know both of these tools. As a
software engineer, you should be able to tackle issues by yourself. Whether
you’ve coded in PHP, Ruby or any other language to build awesome backends,
we’re confident that you will feel at ease with Python.
- **English proficiency**. The team is majoritarily made of French speakers, so
whether you come from an English spoken country or elsewhere, we will have to
communicate in proper English.
- **You know how to use a Version Control System (VCS)**. We work with github
on a daily basis, so we expect you to be able to handle git if you don't already
know it.
- Knowledge of Android development is a plus.

## Technical environment

- Frontend : HTML/Bootstrap (for the landing page) – Android/Kotlin.
- Backend : Python 3.8/Flask.
- Database: PostgreSQL.
- Infrastructure: Heroku.
- Other: Git, Trello, Slack.

## Location

Full-remote. We are all based in France so if you are close to UTC+1, that
would be great but that should not help you from applying to this position.

## Additional information

The expected workload is of 40 hr/week maximum with a negociable hourly rate.
We are looking for a mid-term collaboration starting from August 1st 2021.

## Apply

Shoot us a resume at hello@42hexagons.org.
